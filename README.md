# e-commerce-ws

Hi Coders, This is a spring boot micro services implementation for 
a e-commerce-ws. We are using eureka as the service registry and each 
micro service will be connected to it. 

### Development
Get the code using the following command

``git clone git@github.com:deBilla/e-commerce-ws.git``

Now go inside the folder and go to the configuration-server folder and 
run that service. This will create a server running on http://localhost:8761


After that you can run any micro service and check them in eureka web page in the above link
